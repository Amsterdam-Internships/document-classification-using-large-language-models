DELIVERING ON THE UN’S SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS
– A comprehensive approach
18 November, 2020
The coronavirus pandemic reminds us that the full implementation of the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Development is crucial to strengthen resilience and prepare the world for future shocks, as we embark on
the twin green and digital transitions.
Sustainable development is a core principle of the Treaty on European Union and a priority objective for the Union’s internal
and external policies. The EU was instrumental in shaping the global 2030 Agenda that has become the world’s blueprint for
global sustainable development and for transforming our world.
The European Commission remains committed to the UN’s 2030 Agenda. Under the leadership of President von der Leyen,
the Commission has presented an ambitious policy programme to deliver on sustainability in the EU and beyond. The
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are an intrinsic part of the President’s political programme1 and lie at the heart of the
policymaking on internal and external action across all sectors.

In this figure, the SDGs are represented under a specific Commission political priority
to which they are strongly associated, while noting that most SDGs contribute to
varying degrees, to several priorities.

the climate law, a new Industrial Strategy for Europe, the Annual Sustainable Growth Strategy 2020 and 2021, the new
European Skills Agenda and the European Education Area, among others.

The Commission has an ambitious political programme to deliver a sustainable European Union. Guided by the 17 SDGs, the
Commission has presented numerous policy proposals since 1 December 2019 that will place the EU onto a more solid path
towards sustainability, a rational use of resources and social fairness. Sustainable development is mainstreamed into the
policymaking and economic coordination processes and the Commission continues to monitor progress comprehensively to
ensure that the EU remains on the right long-term track. The EU also continues to take a leading role to promote international
partnerships to support the implementation of the 2030 Agenda in the post-coronavirus world.
The whole of government approach will continue to evolve in the coming years to achieve sustainability at home and abroad.
This is a journey towards a Union that develops and shares prosperity while preserving the life- and economy-supporting
natural ecosystems for this and future generations. A Union that enables its citizens to live well within planetary boundaries.
